	"INTRO": "RICardo (Research on International Trade) is a database on global bilateral trade that covers a period of more than a hundred years, from the beginning of the Industrial Revolution to the eve of World War II. The website aims to explore the history of international trade through visualizations of trade flows between countries from different continents of the world.",
	"COLUMN1": "The RICardo project was initiated in 2004 at Sciences Po by a team of economic historians in order to create a historical database on commercial data. Based on the observation that existing databases are usually built by individual researchers for the purpose of personal research, these databases do not cover all countries of the world, they do not go back before 1870 and they can only be used by skilled communities. Ten years later, a new team involving historians, developers and designers from Sciences Po expands the project to create a website dedicated to global bilateral trade flows between 1800 and 1938. Since the end of World War II, these statistics are collected and published by international organizations: Basic Direction of Trade Statistics from the IMF (data from 1947)",

	"COLUMN2": "The goal of RICardo project is to collect data on the bilateral trade of all countries in the world from the early nineteenth century (the first database goes back to 1787) until 1938 and make them available to a large audience for a wide range of uses. RICardo visualizations allow to show in \"one-click\" what were the Indian exports to France in 1841, how the total trade of China evolved between 1864 and 1913, or to have an estimate of world exports between 1830 and 1938. It facilitates access to a historical and synthetic vision of international trade while offering researchers the opportunity to use the data for further research. RICardo is an evolving database. Our ambition is to keep improving and completing it through further collection of new commercial statistical sources. Users of the database are therefore welcome to send their comments and contribute to its evolution. ",

	"WORKING_PAPER_2": "These papers are not as submitted in their final versions .",
	"TRADE_FLOWS": "Trade flows are values of merchandise exports or imports. The RICardo database combines two sets of data: bilateral trade data are the distribution of total trade of a reporting country with its partner countries; total trade data are the sum of all bilateral exports/imports. Data from the original sources reproduced in the database are quoted in many different currencies. Trade flows have all been converted into sterling pound by using the RICardo exchange rate database.",
	"RICENTITIES": "The entities listed in the dataset are either reporting or partner entities. The term ‘entity’ has been privileged because there are many cases in historical trade statistics where the trading entity does not correspond to an internationally recognized state but describes a locality, an area or a group of states. The list of reporting entities does not match the list of partner entities. The list of RIC entities includes more than 1400 names. They have all been harmonized and translated into English. The entities are identified according to their type that may be: a country, a city/part of a country, a colonial area, a geographical area or a group of countries. The names of the countries have been defined after the Correlates of War country list (\\<a href=\"http://correlatesofwar.org\"\\>correlatesofwar.org \\</a>). The other RIC names have been created.",
	"CONTINENT": "Each entity (reporting or partner) is located on a continent. When the entity is a ‘group’ or a ‘geographical area’ corresponding to a multiple of entities located on different continents, it is identified by the continent ‘World’. The five major continents (Africa, America, Asia, Europe, Oceania) are present in the database plus “continents” pertaining to sea areas (Adriatic, Antarctic, Atlantic Ocean, Baltic, Mediterranean, Pacific). Turkey, when non-specified in Europe or in Asia, has been located in Asia; Russia/USSR, when non-specified in Europe or in Asia, has been located in Europe. ",
	"WORLD_TRADE": "The total trade of an entity corresponds to its trade with the entity partner ‘World’. The total trade of the world (or world trade) is estimated by summing the total trade of all the entities of the database (duplicates are eliminated). There may be up to four estimations of total trade (or trade with partner World):",
	"WORLD_REPORTED": "World reported: total trade of a reporting entity as it is reported in the statistical source. ",
	"WORLD_SUM_PARTNERS": "World sum partners: total trade of a reporting entity equals the sum of all trade partners flows.",
	"WORLD_SUB_REPORTING": "World sub-reporting: total trade of a reporting entity (for example a city) that is dependent on a larger entity (for example a country). ",
	"WORLD_ESTIMATED": "World estimated: recent re-estimations of total trade for some countries (for example Belgium or the Netherlands) and estimations of total trade taken from synthetic sources (for example Mitchell's International Historical Statistics)",
	"WORLD_BESTGUESS": "When many estimations for a country's total trade are available, the World best guess is first World estimated, then World reported, then World sum partnersWorld",
	"MIRROR_FLOWS_1": "The RICardo database offers four bilateral flows for every country pair. A trade flow is recorded twice, by the two partner countries, in two different sources. It is therefore possible to check on the quality of the data by comparing so-called “mirror flows”. The term-to-term comparison of mirror flows (exports from A to B as declared by A and imports from B to A as declared by B) can reveal more or less important differences which are the result either of varying procedures for recording flows by country of origin or destination, or methods for estimating trade flows (c.i.f. vs. f.o.b. estimates, trade types), not forgetting the choice of the exchange rate. The difference between mirror trade flows is such an issue that several studies have been dedicated to its extent and ways to allay its impact.",
	"MIRROR_FLOWS_2": "For more information, see WP Dedinger-Girard.",
	"MIRROR_FLOWS_3": "To help tackle this issue, the bilateral view shows an estimation of the discrepancy in mirror flows that facilitates the detection of major inconsistencies and provides the user with the opportunity to compare data and ultimately select the more reliable figures.",
	"WORLD_VIEW_INTRO": "The \"world\" view shows an estimate of world trade calculated from the total trade flows of all reporting entities. It indicates the number of reporting entities available to calculate the estimate of world trade. It also compares the evolution of the total trade of the selected reporting entities and their share in the world trade.",
