  "ABOUT_INTRO_TITLE": "About",
  "ABOUT_INTRO_LEAD": "The RICardo project was initiated in 2004 at Sciences Po by a team of economic historians. The idea of creating a new historical trade database started from several observations: existing databases were usually built by individual researchers for personal research; these databases did not cover all countries of the world; they did not go back before 1870; and they could only be used by expert audience. Ten years later, a new team involving historians, developers and designers from Sciences Po expanded the project to create a website dedicated to trade exchanges between all of the world’s countries over the 19th and first half of the 20th centuries.",
  "ABOUT_PARA1": "The RICardo project has two components. First, it is a comprehensive trade database that collects total and bilateral trade statistics of all countries in the world from the early nineteenth century (first data go back to 1787) until 1938. Since the end of World War II, these statistics are collected and published by international organizations: Direction of Trade Statistics from the IMF (data from 1947)",
  "ABOUT_PARA11": "; UN Comtrade (data from 1962)",
  "ABOUT_PARA111": "Second, it is a data exploration tool that provides the website’s user with a great variety of data visualizations. It is open to anyone who has some interest in the history of trade and trade globalization. The user can see in 'one-click' what were the Indian exports to France in 1841, how the total trade of China evolved between 1864 and 1913, or how world exports grew between 1800 and 1938. Or he can freely download data for analytical research. Besides, RICardo is an evolving project. Our ambition is to keep completing the database and improving the website. RICardo’s users are therefore welcome to send their comments and contribute to the development of the project.",
  "TEAM_INTRO_TITLE": "Team",
  "TEAM_PARA1": "The RICardo project was initiated in 2004 by Marc Flandreau when he was director of the Chaire Finances internationales at Sciences Po. Béatrice Dedinger was in charge of the scientific coordination supported by Olivier Accominotti, Guillaume Daudin, and Clemens Jobst. Thanks to funds from the Agence nationale de la recherche (ANR 2007-2010), students interns (Thomas Barré, Jérôme Destombes, Vera Quina, Riad Rezzik, Raul Sanchez, Diego Zamuner) have been hired to help us gathering data in Parisians and foreign libraries. Jung-Hyun Ahn worked very efficiently on the management of the database. The ANR period punctuated with a presentation of the project at the WTO in May 2010. At that time, we had built a relatively important trade database (240 000 flows), as well as an exchange rate database to convert into a common unit trade flows expressed in different currencies. We used to work with Access for the standardization of the countries’ names and the monetary conversion of data. Much remained to be done before the database could be made available to the research community, but different career paths led the research team to spread out and put an end to the project.",
  "TEAM_PARA11": "In 2011, Béatrice Dedinger, working at Sciences Po, resumed the project with the help of Guillaume Daudin. She benefited from Sciences Po grants to hire Karine Onfroy and Odile Mazilu who helped her for the database management and the collection of data. In 2013, the RICardo project took on a new dimension. After meeting with Paul Girard, research engineer and technical director of the médialab of Sciences Po, the idea of the creation of a website emerged to better exploit the RICardo database with digital technologies. Thanks to new Sciences Po grants, Béatrice Dedinger and Paul Girard worked to the completion of the website in 2017 together with Matteo Azzi, Mengying Du, Tristan Majou, and Grégory Tible. We couldn't have achieved such a result without the help from Guillaume Daudin and the médialab team (Donato Ricci, Mathieu Jacomy, Benjamin Ooghe-Tabanou, Guillaume Plique and Diégo Antolinos-Basso).",

  "GLOSSARY_INTRO_TITLE": "Glossary",
  "GLOSSARY_TITLE1": "Trade flows",
  "GLOSSARY_DESC1": "Trade flows are values of merchandise exports or imports. The RICardo database combines two sets of data. Bilateral trade data are the distribution of the total trade of a reporting country with its partners. Total trade data are the sum of all bilateral exports/imports (computation explained in the point ‘Total trade’). In the sources used to collect data, trade flows are expressed in many different currencies. They have all been converted into pound sterling by using the RICardo exchange rate database. Conversion rates are market exchange rates except during the periods of great instability for which the gold parity has been used. It concerns the US/£ rate over the years 1861-1865 (American Civil War) and the years 1915-1923 (pound depreciation).",
  "GLOSSARY_TITLE2": "RIC entities",
  "GLOSSARY_DESC2": "The entities listed in the dataset are either reporting or partner entities. The term ‘entity’ has been privileged because there are many cases in historical trade statistics where the trading entity does not correspond to an internationally recognized state but describes a locality, an area or a group of states. The list of reporting entities does not match the list of partner entities. The entities are identified according to their type that may be: a country, a city/part of a country, a colonial area, a geographical area or a group of countries. The names of the countries have been defined after the Correlates of War country list",
  "GLOSSARY_DESC22": "The other RIC names have been created.",
  "GLOSSARY_TITLE3": "Continent",
  "GLOSSARY_DESC3": "Each entity (reporting or partner) is located on a continent. When the entity is a ‘group’ or a ‘geographical area’ corresponding to a multiple of entities located on different continents, it is identified by the continent ‘World’. The five major continents (Africa, America, Asia, Europe, Oceania) are present in the database plus “continents” pertaining to sea areas (Adriatic, Antarctic, Atlantic Ocean, Baltic, Mediterranean, Pacific). Turkey, when non-specified in Europe or in Asia, has been located in Asia; Russia/USSR, when non-specified in Europe or in Asia, has been located in Europe.",
  "GLOSSARY_TITLE4": "World trade / Total trade",
  "GLOSSARY_DESC4": "The total trade of an entity corresponds to its trade with the entity partner ‘World’. The total trade of the world (or world trade) is estimated by summing the total trade of all the entities of the database. There are different ways of calculating the total trade of a country. Rather than selecting a particular estimation, we have decided, in the world view, to show up to five estimations of total trade (or trade with partner ‘World’) to allow for a comparison.",

They include in particular reestimations of total trade historical series (for example, of Belgium or the Netherlands) and sources that have been used to complement total trade data (for example, Mitchell’s International Historical Statistics).",
  "GLOSSARY_LIST4": "when different estimations for a country's total trade are available, ‘World Best Guess’ combines them in the following order of priority. First ‘World estimated’, then ‘World as Reported’, then ‘World Sum Partners’.",
  "GLOSSARY_LIST5": "new estimates of world trade series by Giovanni Federico and Antonio Tena-Junguito,",
  "GLOSSARY_LIST44": "(‘World Undefined’ only concerns total imports of the United Kingdom that we have calculated from an ‘Estimation’ source. See Metadata)",
  "GLOSSARY_TITLE5": "Mirror Flows",
  "GLOSSARY_DESC5": "The RICardo database offers four bilateral flows for every country pair. A trade flow is recorded twice, by the two partner countries, in two different sources. It is therefore possible to check on the quality of the data by comparing so-called “mirror flows”. The term-to-term comparison of mirror flows (exports from A to B as declared by A and imports from B to A as declared by B) can reveal more or less important differences which are the result either of varying procedures for recording flows by country of origin or destination, or methods for estimating trade flows (c.i.f. vs. f.o.b. estimates, trade types, etc.), not forgetting the choice of the exchange rate. The difference between mirror trade flows is such an issue that several studies have been dedicated to its extent and ways to allay its impact.",
  "GLOSSARY_DESC55": "For more information, see WP Dedinger-Girard.",
