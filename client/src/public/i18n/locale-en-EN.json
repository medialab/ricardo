  "ABOUT_INTRO_LEAD": "The RICardo project was initiated in 2004 at Sciences Po by a team of economic historians. The idea of creating a new historical trade database started from several observations: existing databases were usually built by individual researchers for personal research; these databases did not cover all countries of the world; they did not go back before 1870; and they could only be used by expert audience. Ten years later, a new team involving historians, developers and designers from Sciences Po expanded the project to create a website dedicated to trade exchanges between all of the world’s countries over the 19th and first half of the 20th centuries.",
  "ABOUT_PARA1": "The RICardo project has two components. First, it is a comprehensive trade database that collects total and bilateral trade statistics of all countries in the world from the early nineteenth century (first data go back to 1787) until 1938. Since the end of World War II, these statistics are collected and published by international organizations: Direction of Trade Statistics from the IMF (data from 1947)",
  "ABOUT_PARA11": "; UN Comtrade (data from 1962)",
  "ABOUT_PARA111": "Second, it is a data exploration tool that provides the website’s user with a great variety of data visualizations. It is open to anyone who has some interest in the history of trade and trade globalization. The user can see in 'one-click' what were the Indian exports to France in 1841, how the total trade of China evolved between 1864 and 1913, or how world exports grew between 1800 and 1938. Or he can freely download data for analytical research. Besides, RICardo is an evolving project. Our ambition is to keep completing the database and improving the website. RICardo’s users are therefore welcome to send their comments and contribute to the development of the project.",
  "TEAM_INTRO_TITLE": "Team",
  "TEAM_PARA1": "The RICardo project was initiated in 2004 by <b>Marc Flandreau</b> when he was director of the Chaire Finances internationales at Sciences Po. <b>Béatrice Dedinger</b> was in charge of the scientific coordination supported by <b>Olivier Accominotti</b>, <b>Guillaume Daudin</b>, and <b>Clemens Jobst</b>. Thanks to funds from the Agence nationale de la recherche (ANR 2007-2010), students interns (<b>Thomas Barré</b>, <b>Jérôme Destombes</b>, <b>Vera Quina</b>, <b>Riad Rezzik</b>, <b>Raul Sanchez</b>, <b>Diego Zamuner</b>) have been hired to help us gathering data in Parisians and foreign libraries. <b>Jung-Hyun Ahn</b> worked very efficiently on the management of the database. The ANR period punctuated with a presentation of the project at the WTO in May 2010. At that time, we had built a relatively important trade database (240 000 flows), as well as an exchange rate database to convert into a common unit trade flows expressed in different currencies. We used to work with Access for the standardization of the countries’ names and the monetary conversion of data. Much remained to be done before the database could be made available to the research community, but different career paths led the research team to spread out and put an end to the project.",
  "TEAM_PARA11": "In 2011, <b>Béatrice Dedinger</b>, working at Sciences Po, resumed the project with the help of <b>Guillaume Daudin</b>. She benefited from Sciences Po grants to hire <b>Karine Onfroy</b> and <b>Odile Mazilu</b> who helped her for the database management and the collection of data. In 2013, the RICardo project took on a new dimension. After meeting with <b>Paul Girard</b>, research engineer and technical director of the médialab of Sciences Po, the idea of the creation of a website emerged to better exploit the RICardo database with digital technologies. Thanks to new Sciences Po grants, <b>Béatrice Dedinger</b> and <b>Paul Girard</b> worked to the completion of the website in 2017 together with <b>Matteo Azzi</b>, <b>Mengying Du</b>, <b>Tristan Majou</b>, and <b>Grégory Tible</b>. We couldn't have achieved such a result without the help from <b>Guillaume Daudin</b> and the médialab team (<b>Donato Ricci</b>, <b>Mathieu Jacomy</b>, <b>Benjamin Ooghe-Tabanou</b>, <b>Guillaume Plique</b> and <b>Diégo Antolinos-Basso</b>).",
  "TEAM_PARA2": "In 2019, a grant by the Fondation Del Duca allowed the beginning of a new step in the project. It is dedicated to two objectives: to supplement the trade database with a significant number of new data collected from primary sources; to create new visualizations and features on the website. <b>Ariane Treguer</b> has been very helpful in entering the data. <b>Mengying Du</b> has helped to create a tool for integrating data in the base and <b>Arnaud Pichon</b> developed <a href='http://medialab.github.io/GeoPolHist'>the GeoPolHist visualisation tool</a>. During this stage, <b>Paul Girard</b> joined the agency of solutions of data analysis, <a href='https://ouestware.com'>OuestWare</a>, that has been in charge of the renewal of the RICardo website.",

  "GLOSSARY_ENTITIES_TITLE": "Entities",
  "GLOSSARY_ENTITIES_RICentities": "RIC entities",
  "GLOSSARY_ENTITIES_RICentities_content": "The entities of the RICardo database are all the trading entities that are identified in historical sources. The original data set comprises more than 4000 names of entities written in different languages and sometimes pointing to the same entity at different periods of time. A cleaning work has been made to reduce to about 1400 the number of RIC entities, each being designated by a RIC entity name. The complexity of the list of RICardo entities is also one of its richness and derives from strict compliance with original sources. To better understand and manage this list, a first distinction has to be made between reporting entities, i.e. the countries that report and publish trade statistics, and partner entities that are the trade partners listed in trade tables of the reportings. It is important to note that a great number of partner entities are not reporting entities. A second distinction has to be made between different types of RIC entities. In fact, in the original sources, trading entities, in particular partner ones, do not always correspond to a country. They are five types of trading entities in RICardo. The main one is the geopolitical entity (see below), the other ones relate to parts of geopolitical entities, areas or groups of entities. Therefore, each RIC entity is coded as ‘GPH entity’, ‘city/part of’, ‘colonial area’, ‘geographical area’ or ‘group’ of entities.",
  "GLOSSARY_ENTITIES_GPH_entities": "GPH entities",
  "GLOSSARY_ENTITIES_GPH_entities_content": "RICardo’s geopolitical entities (GPH entity) have been named according to the <a href='http://medialab.github.io/GeoPolHist'>GeoPolHist dataset</a> that identifies all of the geopolitical entities of the world by political status since 1816. This dataset has been created from the lists of geopolitical units elaborated by the Correlates of War (COW) project founders in the 1960s to identify all the participants in post-Napoleonian wars. It adds a political dimension to the RICardo trade database by linking each RIC geopolitical entity to the growth of its political status. In GeoPolHist, a geopolitical entity is any form of human social community or territory that has been involved in an international or intra-national conflict during the post-Napoleonic period. The entity is geographically based, inhabited or not, sovereign and independent or not. The entity is political in the Aristotelian sense of the political order, whose ultimate goal is peace through justice inside the entity, war and conflicts remaining a potential option outside the limits of the entity. Through history, political entities of the type “human social community” have taken the form of tribe, chiefdom, city-state, kingdom, empire, caste, seigneury or nation. In the GPH database, political entities of the type “territory” are uninhabited islands, atolls or reefs. GeoPolHist includes a total of 1216 GPH entities.",
  "GLOSSARY_ENTITIES_geoloc": "Geo-localization",
  "GLOSSARY_ENTITIES_geoloc_content": "RICardo includes two indicators of geo-localization. First, each RIC entity is located on a continent. When the entity is a ‘group’ of entities or a ‘geographical area’ corresponding to several entities located on different continents, it is identified by the continent ‘World’. The five major continents (Africa, America, Asia, Europe, Oceania) are present in the database plus “continents” pertaining to sea areas (Adriatic, Antarctic, Atlantic Ocean, Baltic, Mediterranean, Pacific). Turkey, when non-specified in Europe or in Asia, has been located in Asia; Russia/USSR, when non-specified in Europe or in Asia, has been located in Europe. Second, each geopolitical entity is given a geo-localization code defined by using the collaborative encyclopedia Wikidata. For each semantic entity, Wikidata provides a lot of information, its political status, the date of creation/dissolution, the preceding/succeeding entity and, in most cases, a geographical location. However, it must be borne in mind that the list of RIC entities is uniform whereas the political status and the geographical coverage of an entity can change throughout the period covered by the dataset (for example, Yugoslavia/Serbia is a single GPH entity that covers up varying political and geographical reality over the whole period). When different geo-localization codes can be attributed to an entity, one code has been chosen and the user has the opportunity to choose another one by picking up the chain of semantic links (<a href='http://medialab.github.io/publications/geolocaliserRICardo@humanistica2020/'>Girard and Dedinger 2020</a>). Regarding the types of RIC entities that designate areas or groups of entities not identified in Wikidata, a geo-localization code shall be attributed either manually or by using the relations of the entity (the relation ‘capital’ for example).",
  "GLOSSARY_SOURCES_TITLE": "Sources",
  "GLOSSARY_SOURCES_primary_secondary": "Primary vs secondary sources",
  "GLOSSARY_SOURCES_primary_secondary_content": "Primary sources are compilations of a customs statistics published by national authorities. Secondary sources are compilations of primary sources published by national or international authorities. In RICardo, national statistical yearbooks are also included in secondary sources. Primary sources should be favored over secondary sources for they provide a more detailed list of trade partners. However, the collection of primary sources requires important human and financial resources. That is the reason why the RICardo project has first favored the collection of secondary sources. They comprise the Annales du commerce extérieur published by France over 1829-1917, the Statistical Abstract for the several Colonial and other Possessions of the United Kingdom and the Statistical Abstract for the Principal and Other Foreign Countries published by Great Britain over the periods 1850-1947 and 1860-1918. To supplement the data set in the interwar period, the League of Nations’ Memorandum on the balance of payments and the balance of trade and International Trade Statistics have also been perused. A new search and collection of sources has been undertaken as a second step by focusing on primary sources and giving priority to Parisian libraries. The interwar period has also been complemented with primary data collected by Raymond Hicks (A new version of the database will be published in 2022). The complete RICardo database gathers all collected data since the beginning of the project. The <a href='./data/RICardo_trade_flows_deduplicated.csv'>RICardo_trade_flows_deduplicated.csv</a> file is an extraction of the complete data set that eliminates duplicates and favour primary sources. This selective dataset’s sources can be visualized in the <a href='#!/metadata'>Metadata view</a>. ",
  "GLOSSARY_SOURCES_availability": "Availability/localization",
  "GLOSSARY_SOURCES_availability_content": "<p>The collection of data with secondary sources has two benefits: it allows for a better return since one volume can provide bilateral trade statistics for several reportings and sources are more easily accessible. The quasi-complete series of the <i>Annales du commerce extérieur</i> can be found at the <i>Biblitohèque nationale de France</i>,(1) and almost all British <i>Statistical Abstracts</i> can be found in Parisian libraries.(2) The complete series of the League of Nations’ <i>Memoranda</i> is available at the Sciences Po Paris library. The search for primary sources requires more time, resources and efforts. In 2006-2007, the RICardo project has benefited from archives that the Crédit Lyonnais gave to the International finance chair of Sciences Po. They covered trade statistical archives of about ten countries in the world. These archives have been donated to the World Trade Organization in 2010. In 2016, the numerous trade statistical archives located at the <i>Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques</i> (Insee) has been digitized thanks to the help of the library staff. In 2019, here again thanks to exceptional consultative conditions and the help of the staff of the <i>Bibliothèque nationale de France</i>, all the missing trade historical series have been digitized. Archives have also been consulted in Berlin, London, Madrid and Moscow. Eventually, it should be noted that a growing number of trade archives are being digitized and put online by countries’ statistical offices.<p/><p><small>(1) The oldest booklets of the 1e série des Avis divers have been traced at the library of Montauban.<br/>(2) Missing volumes have been consulted at the British Library.</small></p>",
  "GLOSSARY_SOURCES_historical": "Historical trade statistics",
  "GLOSSARY_SOURCES_historical_content": "Historical trade statistics present a number of flaws. First, a trade flow can be alternatively defined as general or special trade. General trade includes all goods entering the country as imports, be they stored, distributed for final consumption or transformed as well as, on the export side, all goods of domestic (be they native or transformed imports) or foreign origin (re-exports). Special trade, by contrast, is submitted to customs clearance operations. It includes, on the import side, all goods put at the disposal of importers (destined either for consumption, merchandising or transformation) as well as goods stored in warehouses destined for domestic consumption (with or without transformation); on the export side, exported domestically produced goods as well as exported domestically transformed imported goods. Transit trade (goods routed through a country for transport reasons) should not be included in either category but this rule can be subject to derogation. In the collection of RICardo data, preference has been given to special trade when available in the sources. Nevertheless, it should be noted that historical sources do not always specify if trade flows correspond to general or special trade. The second important issue with regard to bilateral trade is the recording method of trade partners. From the interwar period, the most used method has been the “production-consumption” method, that is, imports are credited to the country where the good was produced or manufactured in its present form at the time of its entry (country of ultimate origin) and exports to the country of final destination. Previously, two other methods were used: the one in which assessing the origin or destination of the goods consists in recording the country from which or into which these are carried directly; the one that considers the country of consignment, that is, imports are customarily credited to the country from which last directly consigned and the exports to the country to which first directly consigned. These two features of historical trade statistics are largely responsible for the discrepancy in <a href='#!/trade_glossary#mirror_flows'>mirror flows</a>. It is important that the user be alert, not to discourage him from using these data but to allow for a better usage of them.",
  "GLOSSARY_TRADE_TITLE": "Trade",
  "GLOSSARY_TRADE_valuation": "Trade valuation",
  "GLOSSARY_TRADE_valuation_content": "Trade flows are values of merchandise exports or imports. The pricing of traded goods is one of the complex issues raised by historical trade statistics. Two methods of valuation were in use during the period covered by the RICardo database: one using official values, the other declared values. ‘Official values’ represent estimates made by competent authorities that may or not be submitted to more or less frequent revisions. ‘Declared values’ are the values specified by the traders on their customs declaration for each imported and exported good. Official values are usually equated to constant prices and declared values to current prices. Historical examples can help to better understand how problematic these different valuation procedures are for the building of long-term series. Until 1854, when the system switched to declared values, British imports were priced by using a unitary price schedule established at the end of the 17th century. Until 1846, the value of French exports and imports was estimated on the basis of official values scheduled in 1826 by a special Commission. From 1847 to 1928, the value of trade flows was computed each year by the <i>Commission permanente des valeurs de douane</i> on the basis of actual prices. Since 1929, French trade is estimated by using values declared by importers and exporters. It should also be specified that the value assigned to imports is generally the c.i.f. value (cost, insurance, and freight), that includes the price of the good plus the price of the services involved in carrying them from the place of production to the border of the country into which they are introduced (customs tariffs and other import taxes are not included). Exports are generally valued f.o.b. (free on board), which takes account of the price of the good and the freight costs up to the border of the exporting country.",
  "GLOSSARY_TRADE_world": "World trade / total trade",
  "GLOSSARY_TRADE_world_content": "The RICardo database combines two sets of data, bilateral and total trade. Bilateral trade data are the distribution of the total trade of a reporting country with its partners (<a href='/#!/reporting/'>Reporting view</a>). Total trade of a reporting also equates the value of its trade with the partner ‘World'. World trade – or total trade of the entity ‘World' – reflects all the trade flows of all the reportings of the database. The total trade of a reporting can be estimated in using different methods. Rather than selecting a particular one, the <a href='/#!/world/'>World</a> view provides up to three estimations of a reporting's total trade and allows for a comparison between different estimations of the value of world trade:\n  <ul>\n  <li><i>World as Reported</i>: total trade of a reporting entity as reported in the statistical source;</li>\n  <li><i>World Sum Partners</i>: total trade of a reporting entity equal to the sum of all trade partners flows;</li>\n  <li><i>World Estimated</i>: trade values extracted from research studies. They include in particular re-estimations of total trade historical series (for instance, Belgium or the Netherlands) and other studies dedicated to world countries' total trade data such as Mitchell's <i>International Historical Statistics</i>;</li>\n  <li><i>World Best Guess</i>: when different estimations for a country's total trade are available, <i>World Best Guess</i> combines them in the following order of priority. First <i>World estimated</i>, then <i>World as Reported</i>, then <i>World Sum Partners</i>;</li>\n  <li><i>World Federico-Tena</i>: new estimates of world trade series by Giovanni Federico and Antonio Tena-Junguito, <a href='https://www.uc3m.es/tradehist_db'>Federico-Tena World Trade Historical Data Base</a></li>\n  <li><i>World Undefined</i> concerns only total imports of the United Kingdom that have been calculated from an <i>Estimation</i> source (see <a href='/#!/metadata/'>Metadata</a>).</li></ul>",
  "GLOSSARY_TRADE_mirror_flows": "Mirror flows",
  "GLOSSARY_TRADE_mirror_flows_content": "The RICardo database offers four bilateral flows for every entities pair. A trade flow is recorded twice, by the two trading entities, in two different sources. It is therefore possible to check on the quality of the data by comparing so-called “mirror flows”. The term-to-term comparison of mirror flows (exports from A to B as declared by A and imports from B to A as declared by B) can reveal more or less important differences which are the result either of varying procedures for recording flows by country of origin or destination or of methods for estimating trade flows (c.i.f. vs. f.o.b. estimates, trade types, etc.), not forgetting the choice of the exchange rate. The discrepancy between mirror trade flows is such an issue that it fostered a debate on the reliability of trade statistics. To help tackle this issue, the bilateral view adds an estimation of the discrepancy in mirror flows to the visualization of bilateral flows between A (reporting) and B (partner) as reported by A. This estimation provides the user with direct comparison of values declared by A and B. The more the indicator is close to zero, the more trade flows reported by the two entities are coherent.",
  "GLOSSARY_EXCHANGE_RATES_TITLE": "Exchange rates",
  "GLOSSARY_EXCHANGE_RATES_conversion": "Conversion into a common currency",
  "GLOSSARY_EXCHANGE_RATES_conversion_content": "Data from the original sources reproduced in the database are quoted in many different currencies. In the secondary sources, such as the <i>Annales du commerce extérieur</i> or the <i>Statistical Abstract for the Principal and Other Foreign Countries</i>, trade flows are expressed in French francs, pound sterling or  national currency. When expressed in national currency, it should be noted that the exchange used by these two sources is based on the gold parity (constant exchange rate). By contrast, market exchange rates (current exchange rate) have been used to convert into a common currency the trade values tapped from primary sources, except during the periods of great instability for which the gold parity has been used. It concerns the US/£ rate over the years 1861-1865 (American Civil War) and the years 1915-1923 (pound depreciation). The common currency chosen to convert the flows of the RICardo trade database is the pound sterling (reconversion to US dollar is very easy). The conversion rates are taken from the RICardo exchange rate database that has been built for the specific needs of the trade database. Standardized currency names have been created so that each currency is related to a single entity. For instance, it enables differentiating the Chilean peso from the Colombian, Cuban, Mexican or Peruvian peso. The current database gathers 128 currencies, covers the period 1787-1938 and provides around 7300 annual exchange rates.",
  "GLOSSARY_EXCHANGE_RATES_sources": "Exchange rate sources",
  "GLOSSARY_EXCHANGE_RATES_sources_content": "There are available historical exchange rate databases, free or not, such as <i>Global Financial Data</i> or Barbieri’s <i>International Trade Dataset</i> v3.0. These data have not been utilized as they do not meet the specific needs of the RICardo trade database. For instance, the Barbieri database provides total trade flows in 1870 for Argentine, Chile and Columbia in gold pesos. In the RICardo database, for the same year, Argentine trade flows are expressed in Pesos Fuertes, Chilean trade in Pesos and Columbian in Piastres. Many different sources have been consulted to reconstruct an appropriate database. The detailed list of sources is available in the <a href='./data/RICardo_sources.csv'>RICardo_sources.csv</a> file. The main source has been the very rich <i>Währungen der Welt</i> set that provides eleven volumes of historical series of exchange rates for countries all around the globe since the 18th century. It has been supplemented with the <i>Handbook of world exchange rates, 1590-1910</i> (Denzel 2010). Denzel’s <i>Handbook</i> has been used to establish the US/£ current exchange rate series (except over 1861-65). When several exchange rates are provided for one year, the one based on short-term quotation has been chosen. Other sources include recent monographies, secondary trade sources such as the <i>Annales du commerce extérieur</i>, the <i>Statistical Abstract for the Principal and Other Foreign Countries</i> or the <i>Annuaire statistique de la Société des Nations</i>, and additional sources such as the <i>Montevideo-Oxford Latin American Economic History Data Base (MOxLAD)</i> or the <i>Statesman’s Yearbook</i>.",
