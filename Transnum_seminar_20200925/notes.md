# satistics accountability (STS axe)

- why did some sources/reporting used groups, city/part of, colonial area, geographical area ?
- create a typology of groups : types composition, reporting trade share, political or economical link between the group members
- when did some sources reported trade to non-existing (according to COW) countries ? Try to interprete why.

# heterogeneity/scarcity

- import vs export mirror flows discrepancies ? Are imports less reliable than exports ?
- test the hypothesis of transportation cost as an explanation to imports surevaluation ?
- mesure reporting realibility by a discrepancies distribution analysis method (this method exists)
- estimate the coverage of bilateral information on total trade part : 
	- at the global level
	- at the local (reporting) level
- impute missing values
- index and compute a quality index at the network-year level

# fast forward track

- do the network analysis of the bilateral version of Federico-Tena series :
	- what the coverage of RICardo bilateral trade for the FT reporting trhough time ?
	- add the bilateral shares for as much FT reporting entities as possible
	- use the bilateral only to calculate the shares not the values
	- reimpute the bilateral values from the total trade * bilateral shares
	- add the other RICentities with a special status or on a seccond section to assess their impact on first results

# network analysis

- what analysis for which hypothesis ?
- work a path around community detection unstability : re-run the algo, remove swapping entities
- multilevel network model and analysis
- network structure through time
