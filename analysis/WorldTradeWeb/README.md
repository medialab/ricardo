## missing data

## groups of countries

## miror flows
Having miror flows tends to reduce the missing data issue by providing second-hand statistics

## phantom countries
Some trading partners names referes to non-existing countries at the time they are used in sources. 
Examples : Italy, Germany, Switzerland...

# metrics

## density

**number of edges / total number of possible edges**
*[0..1]*
In World Trade Network, density captures the level of integration of the worl trade. If density grows, more countries are trading one with another.

In (De Benidictis et Atjoli 2011), they report (TABLE 2) a density of 
|1950|1960|1970|1980|1990|2000|
|0.067|0.149|0.269|0.334|0.42|0.388|

In RICardo the density charts ends in 1938 at 0.029 with exponential growth the previous years which could ends up at 0.067 in 1950.

But this charts is very suprising between 1890 and 1904.
Although number of countries and flows are rising (flows rising more rapidly than countries), the density decreases!
